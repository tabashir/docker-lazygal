docker-lazygal
==============

A Dockerfile for generating LazyGal galleries

https://sml.zincube.net/~niol/repositories.git/lazygal/about/


Usage
-----

Make a folder (I refer to it here via environment variable as $WORKSPACE)

Into this folder, checkout this repo and your photos so you have:

```
workspace/
  docker-lazygal
  photos
```

```
cd ${WORKSPACE}/docker-lazygal
docker build -t lazygal-builder .
docker run -t -v "${WORKSPACE}":/gallery/files lazygal-builder

```

This will create a folder called 'website'. It will take a long time to run if you have a lot of images.

Then serve your files with:

```
docker-compose up -d

```
